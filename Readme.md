This is a swiss knife SCSS library which has these main functions:

* Fundamental functions for typography: Which will use some kind of library provides the fundations for typography.
* Auto Prefix support: The auto prefix function is the most important reason that Sass mixin exists
* Flexible grid system: Will support two grid system(bootstrap style and the flex style), user can use these functions to generate the grid system they want, will provide a boilerplate code for that too
* Handful CSS user components(maybe use some mature widget kits), but will interfere their SCSS libraries with this(for example, grid system, and typography), so the framework should be pick carefully.

The main purpose of this library is to provide a solid foundation for SCSS development(which is really bad these days), and use this foundation to include some mature widget kits to make them working without too much efforts
